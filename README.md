# time-attack

This is a prototype for an action game involving time manipulation. Right now, the only features I have planned are slowing down, stopping, or reversing time.

I have some ideas for testing the idea of true time reversal in games that I want to test. One is a simple timestamp. Until I get around to that, this project is on pause.
